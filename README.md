ðŸŽ® Classic Pong Game â€“ Python & Turtle Graphics
Developed an interactive desktop game inspired by the classic Pong arcade game, built entirely in Python using the Turtle Graphics library.

Key Features:

Two-player mode with responsive paddle controls (W/S & Arrow keys)

Smooth ball physics with collision detection for paddles and walls

Dynamic score tracking and real-time scoreboard updates

Cross-platform sound integration (Windows, Mac, Linux) for game events

Optimized game loop using ontimer() for efficient rendering and clean exit

Well-structured, readable code for easy customization and feature expansion

Tech Stack: Python, Turtle Graphics, OS & Platform Libraries

This project demonstrates my skills in Python programming, event-driven programming, game logic design, and cross-platform compatibility. It was a fun challenge combining nostalgia with coding, turning an old-school game into a modern Python project.
